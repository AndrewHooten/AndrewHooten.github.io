        <h1>About Us</h1>
        <p>
            We are a nonprofit museum dedicated to the preservation of Railroad History and the heritage of the past, educating present and future generations. Our museum is located in the St. Louis San-Francisco Locomotive No.4524, Burlington Baggage Car, Chicago and Northwestern Commuter Car and Burlington Northern Caboose, as well as the new Max Jahn Depot. The depot is a replica of an 1890s-era rural depot, based on the original prints from the depot at Elsinore, MO. There are many hands-on activities for visitors of all ages. We also have videos of  Steam and Diesel Trains, and a Model Train Layout. You are welcome to explore the Frisco Locomotive 4524, Commuter Car, Caboose, and the depot.
